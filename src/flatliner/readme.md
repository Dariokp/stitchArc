# Flatliner Module

## Overview

This module is derived from [flatliner-src](https://github.com/hhc97/flatliner-src) repository.

## Modifications

The original code has been augmented with `transformations.py` to make the resulting one-lined lambda expressions compatible with the python-to-stitch translator.
