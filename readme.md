# Python to Stitch Translator for ARC Challenge

This repository contains code to translate Python functions into Stitch code, specifically applied to the ARC-AGI challenge.

## Overview

The translator follows these steps:

1. Extracts Python functions from the [re-arc](https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-arc.git) repository
2. Transforms them into one-line lambda expressions using the [flatliner](https://github.com/hhc97/flatliner-src.git) repository
3. Applies custom modifications for syntax compatibility
4. Utilizes the [lotlib3](https://github.com/thelogicalgrammar/LOTlib3.git) repository to convert Python lambda expressions into Stitch syntax

## Library Learning

Once translated to [Stitch](https://github.com/mlb2251/stitch.git), the code applies Stitch, a library learning algorithm that discovers higher-level abstracted functions by identifying commonalities across all functions.

## Purpose

This project aims to bridge Python and Stitch implementations of ARC solutions, enabling better pattern recognition and abstraction capabilities through Stitch's specialized language features.
